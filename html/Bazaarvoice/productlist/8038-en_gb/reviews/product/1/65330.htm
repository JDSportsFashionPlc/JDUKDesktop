</span><span class="description"> My son just received his shoes and as like the previous review 1 of the trainers is dirty, I am going to go to the shop to return them., just not good enough ...shoes are great but let down by the condition that JD sent them. If I wanted second hand shoes I would go to a charity shop.

</span><span class="description"> I had no problem with the product it self, I just didnt like the fact that when I got the trainers out of the delivery bag they looked like one of the staff had been wearing them for the day on the work floor. They just wearnt fresh!!! They had dirt stains on, the trainer sole was covered in marks. Not HAPPY! The only reason I never returned them was that I was going on holiday the same evening I recieved them.
