</span><span class="description"> this product is really worth its money ,this is the first time i have purchased a jacket as i usually wear tracksuit tops or hooded tops. i really needed a decent jacket and took the chance on this jacket and i am totally happy with the whole thing.I particularly like the hood .its comfy to wear and is as good to wear in winter and can be used in summer as its not to thick and the thinness lets u wear a trackie top or summit underneath for colder weather.i love this jacket and recomend it to young and old .
