</span><span class="description"> For about £55 i would have expected this to be a better quality, when i wore it the shoulders of the jacker came out really puffy as though they had something under them, but then and again its what you prefer, the overall quality was ok but price was way out of proportion i would have expected it to be at about£ £35-40 looking at it. The pockets were bery small especially if you wanted to put in a iphone. But if you arent as fussy as me the. Its pretty average the inner pars were good, very nice and light and excellent for the summer.
