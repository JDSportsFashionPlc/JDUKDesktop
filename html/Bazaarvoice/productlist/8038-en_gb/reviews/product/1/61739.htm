</span><span class="description"> Bought these for my 8 year old son's birthday. Ordered online on Saturday and they were delivered to my local store by Thursday in time for his birthday on the Friday. He loved them and is not taking them off!! He says they are easy to put on and lace up and very comfortable to wear. As always very impressed with the service received by JD Sports and the staff are very helpful and friendly (Hemel Hempstead store). Thank you JD.
