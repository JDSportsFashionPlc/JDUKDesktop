</span><span class="description"> I brought this bag for my son for school, was great value, and perfect for what he needed, plenty of space for books, lunch boxes and much more, a great inside zipped pocket for items needing more security and separation from rest of bag, plus a handy pocket at the front for things you need to have close to hand.
This bag would also be good for sports goods, day trips and even as a baby bag.
Good quality and great value for money.
