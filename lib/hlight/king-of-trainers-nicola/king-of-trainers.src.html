				<h2>adidas Originals ZX750</h2>
				<div class="section-info-content">
							<p>A mainstay from the adidas running catalogue, the adidas Originals ZX750 takes a vintage approach to the late 80s runner with the application of yellowing to the traditionally white midsole, and the use of rich suede on the upper with tiny details of 3M throughout. We're not unfamiliar to loud ZX releases from the adi camp, but these no-nonsense classics are a great subtle addition to the adidas collection.<br />
										<span class="price">&pound;65 &ndash; &pound;75</span></p>
				</div>
	</div>
	<div class="section-info">
				<h2>adidas Originals ZX700</h2>
				<div class="section-info-content">
							<p>It's difficult not to get excited about the extensive adidas Originals' ZX family, and the ZX700 is amongst the collections most powerful players. Built for long distance running, with an incredibly lightweight yet durable outsole, and a shape that considered the tiniest details of biomechanics, the ZX700 has been putting in the miles for three decades, and is still going strong. These three new arrivals grace our shelves in time for the New Year, offering a combination of mesh and buttery soft suede, and soft flashes of colour that complement the simplistic two-tone uppers.<br>
										<span class="price">&pound;65</span></p>

	<div class="section-info">
				<h2>Nike Air Max 95 &#8216;Brave Blue&#8217; </h2>
				<div class="section-info-content">
							<p>The Nike Air Max 95 remains a favourite of ours at JD HQ, but we're particularly enjoying this &#8216;Brave Blue&#8217; rendition as a slight break from the classic AM95 make-ups. The distinctive upper features a tonal Brave Blue nubuck and mesh overlay, but the clever placement of snow white accents couldn't be more appropriate for the winter season. The bold blocking on the tongue and the visible air unit in particular make this colourway a gem in any serious Air Max collection, and a definite favourite of ours from this year.<br>
										<span class="price">&pound;35 &ndash; &pound;120</span></p>
				</div>
	</div>
	<div class="section-info">
				<h2>adidas Originals MC-X1</h2>
				<div class="section-info-content">
							<p>A new addition to adidas Originals basketball range, the mid-cut MC-X1 is a pure basketball inspired style with clean lines and a sturdy court-meets-street fusion of attitude and aesthetic. The upper is made up of synthetic nubuck, flashing semi-shiny leather details, a tonal coloured outsole and TPU moulded 3-Stripes. If you like to make a statement with your footwear, then these are a must-have addition for the new year.<br>
										<span class="price">&pound;70</span></p>
				</div>
	</div>
	<div class="section-info">
				<h2>Nike Air Max Light</h2>
				<div class="section-info-content">
							<p>Originally named the Air Max II, released as the sequel to the now infamous Air Max 1 release in 1986, The Nike Air Max Light graced the shelves in 1989 offering some subtle design changes to the originator and the same Nike Air flavour - The same thermoplastic straps, the same breathable mesh and suede combo, and the same visible Air-Sole unit.<br>
										<span class="price">&pound;90</span></p>
				</div>
	</div>
	<div class="section-info">
				<h2>adidas Originals ZX8000</h2>
				<div class="section-info-content">
							<p>The adidas Originals ZX8000 was a big mover in the late 80's - It offered the same trademark styling that ZX fanatics were familiar with, but continued to push the boundaries of the progressive running series. Enhanced heel support, a removable Torsion inlay sole and top-level lightweight cushioning meant that the futuristic aesthetic of the adi runner was up to scratch with it's technical offering.<br>
										<span class="price">&pound;80</span></p>
				</div>
	</div>
	<div class="section-info">
				<h2>adidas Originals Bamba</h2>
				<div class="section-info-content">
							<p>Originally designed with football in mind, the adidas Originals Bamba has had a tough time striking out as a lifestyle silhouette due to the overwhelming popularity of the Samba. The original featured a glossy leather upper that was treated to repel water for use on wet pitches, but while this practical application might be a thing of the past, the Bamba features the same fluid shape and premium design.<br>
										<span class="price">&pound;62</span></p>
				</div>
	</div>
	<div class="section-info">
				<h2>Puma Suede</h2>
				<div class="section-info-content">
							<p>The Puma Suede remains true to its roots as the footwear choice of eccentrics and progressive thinkers with these two new women's pastel-inspired arrivals. Both colourful renditions feature clean suede uppers with a contrasting white formstripe and gold embossed details.<br>
										<span class="price">&pound;28 &ndash; &pound;55</span></p>
				</div>
	</div>
	<div class="section-info">
				<h2>Nike Air Max Terra 180 'Oreo'</h2>
				<div class="section-info-content">
							<p>Another demonstration of footwear designer Tinker Hatfield's mastery, the Nike Air Max 180 introduced a further revolutionary feature to the visible air series in 1992 with a 180 degree Nike Air unit. The shoe was designed with simplicity in mind so that the Air-Sole remained the key characteristic, and this 'Oreo' dubbed rendition keeps it classic with a straight up black and white colourway.<br>
										<span class="price">&pound;110</span></p>

				<h2>New Balance 574 Canteen Pack</h2>
				<div class="section-info-content">
							<p>Supposedly inspired by the weather hardy great-outdoors accessory, the canteen, New Balance's 'Canteen Pack' tells a nice tonal story with brown and gum details reminiscent of trademark hiking gear.

				<h2>adidas Originals ZX750</h2>
				<div class="section-info-content">
							<p>adidas Originals have been working hard to re-establish the ZX running series alongside the markets current leaders, and with consistent tasteful ZX500 releases throughout 2013, it seems like a great time to shift our focus to the 80's retro - the ZX750. We're confident that it won't take much for these tonal winter revisions to gain a bit of momentum. All three of these suede and mesh make-ups is available now both in-stores and online now Only at JD.<br>

				<h2>adidas Originals LA Trainer</h2>
				<div class="section-info-content">
							<p>The adidas Originals LA Trainer first appeared trackside at the 1984 Olympics Games in Los Angeles, the same year that adidas moved its production from Germany to France, and has since remained a mainstay in the adidas catalogue as a result of its undeniable popularity. Aside from the trainer's obvious aesthetic appeal, one of the styles most notable features is the one-of-a-kind Vario Shock Absorption System - three pegs located in the heel of the midsole that allowed the user to adjust the shoe's cushioning. Pretty innovative, right..?<br>
										<span class="price">&pound;30 - &pound;65</span></p>
				</div>
	</div>
	<div class="section-info">
				<h2>Nike Air Max 95 'Black Ice'</h2>
				<div class="section-info-content">
							<p>We're especially fond of the Air Max 95 - The sloping shape, the detailed layering of fabrics on the upper and the additional flashes of air in the forefoot make for some incredibly exciting colour combinations. With that in mind, though, sometimes it's the subtle additions that make the shoe. The flashes of blue against the black, and the unmistakable premium patent panelling remind us of treacherous black ice, so this striking colourway couldn't have come at a more appropriate time as we approach Christmas.<br>
										<span class="price">&pound;35 - &pound;120</span></p>
				</div>
	</div>
	<div class="section-info">
				<h2>New Balance 574 'Sonic Weld'</h2>
				<div class="section-info-content">
							<p>The New Balance 574 Sonic Weld was created as an environmentally friendly solution to the waste produced during the production process, but the melting technique that was used to seal the separate panels together created simplicity and fluidity that the 574 hadn't previously offered. The 574 Sonic Weld returns with the same flawless aesthetic as the shoes first release, with three incredible colourways that demonstrate exceptional colour blocking and minimal use of detailing.<br>

				<h2>Asics GT II &amp; Gel Lyte III</h2>
				<div class="section-info-content">
							<p>Over the last six decades, Asics have delivered a considerable amount of game changing footwear innovations, but none with quite as much longevity as the Gel cushioning system. Their success lies as much with innovation as it does with flawless footwear design, though, with truly timeless silhouettes like the Gel Lyte III (with its immediately distinctive split tongue feature) and the GT II evolving into iconic lifestyle creations.<br>

				<div class="section-info-content">
							<p>The Nike Air Max 90 is the don of the vis air family - Although not the first, it remains one of the most popular of the series due to its sloping shape and the plethora of colourway options that its layered upper allow. These three new arrivals stay in line with the seasonal colour pops that we've seen on some of the Air Max 90's vis air siblings, and make clever use of the same suede and ripstop fabrics that we've seen on the 'Split Pack' and 'Ripstop Pack' too.<br>
